# HTML_CSS_hogwarts_website
First attempt at a functioning HTML &amp; CSS website.
This site is not for redistribution. It a simply a personal project I have undertaken based on the fictional school from Harry Potter. 
It has allowed me to create a HTML based website and then adding CSS to demonstrate the styling and layout of each page. 
This will likely be an ongoing project where i will look to incorperate Javascript in the future.
